Here are codes required to interface with already installed TALYS:

So install TALYS first: https://tendl.web.psi.ch/tendl_2019/talys.html
Follow the instructions and set $TALYS = ..

Here is mine:
$TALYS/source = /media/cubist/files/all/duke_research/tools/talys/talys/source

For this directory compile via:

cd talysInterface/source
gfortran -I$TALYS/source *.f
mv *.f ../obj

Basically first go to the source directory, then compile with your fortran compiler (sam you
used for preparing TALYS), then copy the object files to talysInterface/obj

Main NEWTON installation will use these codes, after this NEWTON installation is easy:
make newtonRun
