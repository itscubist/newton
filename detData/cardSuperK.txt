# Card File For SK Detector, Information Describing Detector Size, Shape, Material is Here
# Also have standard info like Avogadro's number, molecular weight of the detector material...
# Basically what you need to calculate event rate besides flux and xscn
# --- Means Not Existing
# Name
DET_NAME SK
# AVOGADRO's NUMBER in units of 10^23 mol^(-1)
NAVOGADRO 6.0221415
# Name of material (needed to scale xscns with how many targets per molecule) 
MATERIAL WATER
# Molecular Mass of the Given Material in grams/mol
MOLARMASS 18.01528
# Density of material In (metric)tons/m^3 -> equal to g/cm^3 too
DENSITY 1.0
# Mass of the detector in Metric Tons (NOT KiloTons, NOT Kilograms) (full ID volume for SK)
DETMASS 32000.0
# Simulation Time (in Years)
DETYEARS 5000.0
# Years to Seconds Ratio (divided by 10^7)
SECONDSINYEAR 3.1557600
# For precision reasons, Xscn is multiplied by 10^38, nAvo by 10^-23, years/seconds by 10^-7  
# Detector mass is in Tons so a factor of 10^-6 comes from there (using tons instead of grams)
# To fix these units, the final event count will be multiplied by this number: 0.01
UNITFIXER 0.01
# Determines whether event count varies as a Poisson based on the info above, or fixed
# if negative then Poisson, else fixed number of events for each xscn, the number below
# is that fixed number of events, ex: If you want to create N events of all interactions,
# regardless of how many there will be physically, set it to N...
# if exactly 0, then event count is from det/xscn/flux info, but no Poisson fluctuations
FIXEDEVENTCOUNT 0
# If set (non-zero) then event vertices will all be at 0,0,0
DETCENTERONLY 0
# Detector geometry, supported options are: "RECTANGULAR", "CYLINDRICAL" and "SPHERICAL"
DETGEOM CYLINDRICAL
# Detector Dimensions (give x,y,z for rectangular; z,r for cylenderic; and only r for spheric)
DETX 0
DETY 0
# Full ID
DETZ 3620.0
DETR 1690.0
# If wall>200 FV only
# DETZ 3220.0
# DETR 1490.0
# DETZ and DETR were put to be fiducial sizes wall-200, might update to wall-100 with based on
# recent developments, then also need to update detector mass
# Alternatively, one can make the code calculate mass from detector size and density
